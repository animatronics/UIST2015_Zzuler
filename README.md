In this work, our team (ZZULER) proposes Innovative Editing Tool for animatronics and its Input controller.
Zzuler means "AWESOME!" in Korean. We tried to develop an *awesome* application by [PROCESSING](https://processing.org/) and [ARDUINO](https://www.arduino.cc/).


##INNOVATIVE ANIMATRONICS EDITING TOOL

This is a graphic authoring environment called IAET (Innovative Animatronics Editing Tool) for visually creating animatronics.

The IAET includes four areas for authoring animatronics:

1. Recording 
2. Editing 
3. Saving movement block 
4. Synchronizing 


For recording motion as a block, IAET receives movement signals from a mini puppet and tranmits control signals after processing the movement signals. An animatronics show is created when a user drags a block to the timeline. 


##MINI PUPPET CONTROLLER

This interface is focusing on creation of puppet movements by synchronizing the actions between a sensor puppet and an actuator puppet.
The input interface is the mini control puppet being tightly coupled with the large puppet made to act.
